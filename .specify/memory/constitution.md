# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration
Collaboration across AI, robotics, biomechanics, cognitive science, and ethics is paramount to ensure comprehensive and responsible development.

### Ethical AI Development
Adherence to ethical standards, prioritizing human well-being, autonomy, privacy, fairness, bias detection, transparency, and accountability in all aspects of AI design and deployment.

### Robustness & Safety Engineering
Engineering for extreme robustness, reliability, and safety in unpredictable environments. This includes comprehensive risk assessment and rigorous testing methodologies.

### Human-Robot Interaction Design
Focus on designing intuitive, natural, and trustworthy human-robot interaction, carefully considering psychological, social, and cultural factors for seamless integration.

### Continuous Learning & Adaptation
Systems must be designed to continuously learn, adapt, and improve through real-world interaction, fostering long-term resilience and performance.

## Technical Standards

Leverage advanced simulation environments for prototyping and validation. Emphasize hardware-software co-design to optimize performance and integration across physical and digital domains.

## Research & Development Workflow

Adopt an iterative, hypothesis-driven research and development workflow. Implement rigorous peer review processes and foster effective knowledge transfer within the project team.

## Governance
All project activities and decisions must align with the core principles outlined in this constitution. Amendments require documented rationale, approval, and a plan for consistency propagation.
